        A: The model has approximately 90% accuracy on test data, but results may vary based on image quality and conditions.
        
        **Q: What types of plants can this model analyze?**
        
        A: Currently, the model can identify diseases in: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato.
        
        **Q: Why isn't my plant's disease being detected correctly?**
        
        A: The accuracy of detection depends on several factors:
        - Image quality and lighting
        - The angle at which the leaf is photographed
        - Whether the disease symptoms are clearly visible
        - If the disease is in an early stage, symptoms might not be distinct enough
        
        **Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?**
        
        A: This is a demonstration application and should not be used as the sole basis for commercial agricultural decisions.
